# CSFB

The point of this is to automatically make a plan in a facebook groupchat before a lecture. This plan factors in walking time to the lecture location and wait time for everybody to meet.

## If you want to get this to work


to get this to work you will need to make a file called details.txt
within this file have the following:

`<email>,<password>,<ThreadID>`

e.g. `tom@tmoses.co.uk,superSecure8,19381221`

you will also need to get your `credentials.json` and `token.json` file from the google API and probably change the calendar ID.
